# Freemotes V.1.5
 "Free" Discord Nitro with extra steps
 ~~Basically a gif sender~~
#### All gif emotes are edited to 49px x 49px to mimic real emotes at standard Discord size


How it works...

1. Reads and saves all csv data into a dictionary
**Make sure there are no spaces in csv and follow formatting (using commas) or else it won't work properly**

2. Detects keypresses and if in a specific pattern, types out a gif link.
	Ex:
	> input: ":pepelaugh:" + any key press after
	> output: a link associated with the key :pepelaugh:

## Available Functions

On Tab Press:
- Autocompletes emote based on closest search
 	Ex:
 	> input: ":pepel" + tab key press
 	> output: ":pepelaugh:"
